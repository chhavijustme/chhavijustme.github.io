As an intern, you bear an utmost responsibility, to pay your respects to the esteemed, distinguished, much awaited, classified apart from the grind; days called **weekend**. Just to keep up with the reputation of the word, and Instagram filters screaming stuff like Friyay. Just that, no other thing.

In a typical filmy way, you should decide to start it slow. A house party with pizza, board games and grizzly bears (not beers). The intern version of it is goes as precise inter-paytm transactions and a few jugad-ed online coupons, to bulk order pizzas and a [mobile game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.ellen.psych&hl=en), called psyched, where you answer stupid questions with stupid-ier answers and then choose the stupid-est answer from the pooled stupid answers.

Saturday morning, comes with a heartbreak and painful _vidaa_i. Of leaving the comforts of the sponsored luxury hotel and moving on to a room with a bed. Yes, that’s all that the room has. With just two bags and a cab/flight, you could have moved to another city or even a country.

> That feeling of being so _portable_ (for the lack of better word), is something you should hold on to as long as you can.

To make up for morning heartbreak, decide to attend a rooftop poolside concert of some band you have never really heard but they mix songs and they don’t even use any instruments (medley and a cappella, are the respective terms). Fancy again. Only it will rain and it will get cancelled. And, and. You might also forget to check the refund policies.

Sunday morning brings hope. That you will be able to shower once you go and get a bucket (I wasn’t kidding when I said it is just a room with a bed). Only the mall finds it the perfect time to give away one free bucket with one. Now also on your to-do list, “sell the extra bucket to someone in office”.

Oh wait, weekend without a movie isn’t a weekend. Go watch the number five of the series of the movies you haven’t watched even one of. It won’t turn out that bad and you can even squeeze in a dinner consisting only of fancy desert(s).

I think you did a pretty good job this weekend.

Until next week. Do not panic if you realise that room service just vanished and you are late in posting your weekly blog.

With hopes that one day the links will be sufficient to binge read on the roadway around galaxy.
