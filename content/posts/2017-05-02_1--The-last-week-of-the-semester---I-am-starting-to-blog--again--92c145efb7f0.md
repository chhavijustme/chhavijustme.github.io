This is that weird time of the year. Where assignments feel like bad relationships you can’t get out. Where you wait and double check before submitting your answer scripts if the professor is reading it, then and there. So much for patience. And much more for impatience to be on the flight back home, because the mess food is now unbearable. Is it just me or during the last week, all the cooks give up? Happens to be when I am feeding off a lot of fiction but have to be careful carrying my novel around. Other times I am tagged an avid reader. During this time, _design-wali_. Perspectives and Contexts.

It is also that time of the year where it rains at nights and streetlights paint the roads golden (or at times silver). The time where social media is flooded with pictures of the graduating batch. The time when you realise it is that moment in their lives, where the backdrop of their entangled stories is about to, change. Also the time you realise how your elder siblings feel at weddings when told, next is you.

> It just so happens to be the time I realised, in future I can always delete what I write here, but I cannot come back to this time here and write it.

Until next week. Don’t Panic, even if you find out we are just living on a blue dot revolving around a bigger yellow dot.

PS : So if you are wondering why I added the 1 in the title, I came around this writing challenge to write for the next 52 weeks and I read this book that tells to do a thing 21 days to make it a habit and also I am watching 13 reasons why. But no obviously not, none of it is related. I don’t know either why I added that.

With hopes that one day the links will be sufficient to binge read on the roadway around galaxy.
