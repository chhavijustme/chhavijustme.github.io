While Medium has a great onboarding, strong recommendation engine and an option to get daily digests customized for you in your inbox, sometimes all you are looking for is a friend to recommend a list of authors they have spent hours reading and learning from. **Someone they find worth coming back to Medium for.**

I have been a voracious reader on Medium for almost 4 years now. I made intentional decisions to follow, unfollow and find authors that I love.

#### Here is a list of 9 people to follow on Medium I would recommend to a friend.

1.  [**Benjamin Hardy**](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy) While at first, you might discard this as self-help stuff that you don’t need, over time you will realize he is simply pointing out what you already know you need to do. And it’s about time you start doing it.

**9\.** [**Jack Herlocker**](https://medium.com/@jherlocker)  
If you end up reading just one author from this list, read his. Reading his series on conversations with his wife is everything that makes Medium a home. [**@jherlocker**](http://twitter.com/jherlocker "Twitter profile for @jherlocker")

That was about my list, I couldn’t find the tenth person to complete the list. I think it’s time for me to explore more authors as well.

Who you follow on Medium, also affects your suggested stories. What they recommend and highlight frequently show up on your suggested reading list. So follow people who write, but also who read a lot. Happy reading!
