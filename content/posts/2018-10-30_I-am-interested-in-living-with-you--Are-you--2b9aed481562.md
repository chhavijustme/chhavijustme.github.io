The amusing ordeal of finding flat and flatmates in Bangalore.

Finding a house to stay in Bangalore is very similar to dating. You have to put yourself out there and be prepared to get rejected just because there are no utensils in your potential kitchen.

So why would you even do it? The thing is they forget to teach in school, the mathematics of a salary paycheck. The subtractions from the gross total are much more ruthless. Plus, it’s monumentally relieving to have an additional person crosscheck there is electricity in the house, plants are watered and groceries in the fridge.

Hence begins your almost endless search on renting platforms. You declare your interests. No matter what you post, you mean a

> 2/3 BHK with a gym that I will never use. Swimming pool for the Insta stories. Furnished because I do not want to track freedom day sales on Amazon. Separate bathrooms because I am already late to office without having to wait in a queue. Also, please don’t mind Swiggy delievry guy showing up at the door every other day.

Brokers are that aunties in colonies. They have nothing substantial to add to your search for significant others, but according to them, their presence is consequential in deciding the fate of the relationship.

Scrounging through the posts, you find, “Looking for “#chilled” flatmate.” I am thoroughly confused with the connotations of the word chilled in all the Facebook ads. What exactly are you implying and what exactly am I confirming to when I comment on it “Interested”.

Well, I said a prayer and plunged right into it. Settling into my new house,

PS: I plan to write more about my life in Bangalore and other design, travel, ongoing Swiggy-Uber experiences. Be kind enough to stick around for the craziness! :)
