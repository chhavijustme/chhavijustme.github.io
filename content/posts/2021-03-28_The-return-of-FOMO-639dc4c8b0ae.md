I spread myself lazily across the couch in my silk pajama set on a Saturday morning. This pajama set has been one of my best investments, my wallet disagrees with my instagram story if itâ€™s worth it, but myself in lockdown vigorously agrees.

Treating this as yet another Saturday, I sip my revitalising botanical drink. Donâ€™t ask, weâ€™ve all picked things from supermarket we donâ€™t need this pandemic.

#### And so for a brief moment, the rare London sun, the revitalising botanical drink, the overpriced silk pajamas, that side project I am finally working on, and I, have aÂ moment.

And then, I opened Instagram. Oops.

Stay-at-home ends this week. 20 Best places to spot cheery blossoms. Best parks to picnic this Bank Friday. 14 floral trends for this spring. Weather to soar upto 18 Â°C. Best day trips for summers. Best summer yet to come yet.

While I have grieved losing my freedom in bits and pieces and sometimes all together fullyâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI have also found relief in staying in. And and having a legit legal reason to do so. Listen, the government told me so.

As much as I enjoyed THE moment a while ago, I cannot deny I terribly miss sipping wine in my little black dress in a London pub. Also it doesnâ€™t matter if I am in silk pajamas or the little black dress, I am live tweeting or not, I have, and will always suffer from FOMO.

My dear Naina-Bunny fans will find this moment very apt to remind me of the very legendary scene here.

But hear me out, I feel Deepika really just said, no matter who you are, where you are and what you are doing, FOMO will find you.ðŸ™ƒ

#### So my dear friends, we are left with no choice but to slow-clap, and roll our eyes as we reacquaint ourselves with the joy ofÂ FOMO.

_Letâ€™s start celebrating our friends who will be (or already are) getting vaccinated, vacationing on a sunny beach, singing their hearts out in a concert, but thankfully stop baking sourdough and doing yoga headstands._

_Letâ€™s celebrate the end of our weekly mental subscription to find-100-ways-to-pass-time-at-home, and subscribe to a daily delivery of FOMO packaged as Insta stories filled with gifs and polls._

_Letâ€™s celebrate not having much options for so long that we considered life without FOMO as an option. Because no matter what we do, FOMO will always find us in the nooks and crannies of our lives, and we will always prefer it over itâ€™s cousin JOMO._

#### Letâ€™s celebrate the return ofÂ FOMO.

Furiously digging in my cupboard to find an outfit fit to wear to the premier of, Return of the FOMO. Chhavi
