Hi Jessica, loved the illustrations. They look fun and approachable. For my team, I built a quick friendly checklist inspired by [http://uxchecklist.github.io/](http://uxchecklist.github.io/). It has everything — list of Slack channels they can be part of, who to reach out for tool licenses, recurring team meetings, etc. Great article, looking for more from you soon!
