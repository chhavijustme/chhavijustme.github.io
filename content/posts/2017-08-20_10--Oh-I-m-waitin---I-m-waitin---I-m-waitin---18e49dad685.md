Have you ever waited for something really bad? I mean obviously you must have. I have too. For the temperature of the shower to come to the right temperature after I open both hot and cold taps. For Jon Snow and Daenerys to meet. For flight tickets to come down so that I can fly home. For people to read my blog after I publish it. For my bestie to realize I was right about that guy, so that I can say “I told you so”. For the treadmill to finally hit the number so I can get down. For the amazon package from my guilty shopping spree to be delivered. For Photoshop to render my long heavy design files. For the OTP to show up when I am trying to book the last of the movie tickets. For JK Rowling to write Harry Potter, part 4. 1 !!!

Apart from all the above, I am waiting for something. It is (partly) driving me crazy I am cannot employ the services of a three eyed raven to see where it is.

Apart from the waiting, I have been caught up with my BTP (the one year project you do to get your degree, more about it later). It’s like a relationship, which needs so much commitment and devotion. Only difference, it promises to let go of you after a year, without a fuss.

Until the wait is over and I can update you about it.

With hopes that one day the links will be sufficient to binge read on the roadway around galaxy.
