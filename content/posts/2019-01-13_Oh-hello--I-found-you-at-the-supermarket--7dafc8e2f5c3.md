As one of the prerequisites to being an adult, you have to show up at a grocery store once a week. If you don’t, consequences can be as severe as Swiggy-ing for an entire week or knocking on your neighbor's doors for some potatoes and salt.

As part of this weekly ritual, I usually show up at this nearby supermart. Mostly it’s Sunday evenings, very adult-like I know. And unfailingly I find some variations of the following species.

1.  **The Couple.  
    **While moving across the supermart, there is always this one couple who is communicating across aisles.

> “Do we need this cheese? Do we have enough cereal? What kind of rice should I pick?”

This is clearly the kind of couple who feels they need to tell the entire supermart that they came to their weekly grocery shopping trip, and hence need to be deemed super responsible and super in a relationship.

When they were single, they were loyal customers of BigBasket. Now that they have a partner who forces them to show up in a supermarket and choose between various kinds of wheat. So they do. They are equal parts grateful and resentful for this trip.

**2\. The Bachelor.**  
While the couple is busy choosing between different kinds of rice, this one silently pushes across his heavy trolley towards the cash counter. He shouldn’t be standing out, but all those muscley-muscles, I-go-to-a-gym looks do stand out. So does his cart filled up to the brim with eggs, frozen meat, bananas and then some obviously, some more eggs.

**3\. The Kids.**  
I feel for kids, visiting a supermart is an upgrade from going to a mall. They can stop by every aisle and declare they want it. They want it because they want to eat it. Parents have to look beyond that cuteness and reject so many pitches.

Most of them, at least who are not teeny-weeny, seem to be really protective about their carts as well. You cannot just stare at their cart, without them taking it a bit further from you.

**4\. The Me.**  
And then there are people like me. Tempted by the overpriced exotic fruits and organic olives, but making their way towards the ready-to-eat section. I am still new at it.

I try to figure out which oil to buy and then pick up the one which has one liter free on buying five. (Doesn’t really matter I came to buy 2 liters of oil!) Picking up the more costly dish wash liquid this time, because saving 10 bucks on it last month wasn’t really worth it.
