I have been living away from home since college, so I assumed I covered the ground skills. But throw in a paycheck, an empty fridge, a couple of people who need to be paid every month, and God-knows-why choking kitchen sink…and days in hostel seem to be a cake-walk.

Over the last few months, I realized I have developed all these tiny signs which clearly say I am learning to live alone.

**My metrics of a running household.**  
Eggs in kitchen, toothpaste in the bathroom and clothes in your wardrobe. Well, I won’t starve and I don’t stink. That’s nice. I use these to give a status update to my mom every night.

**Is it worth the hustle?**  
I stand in a shop or stare at a grocery app to try and decide. Do I need a jasmine or a lemon washing powder? Or should I just go with the one that is giving 20 bucks off? Wait what, organic washing powder?

**Fifty kinds of eggs**  
I never realized how eggs can save nights. No veggies for dinner, make eggs. No cornflakes for breakfast, make eggs. Drank too much and forgot to eat and now you can’t sleep. You got me, make eggs.

**Are those for me?**  
Sometimes when I read the sticky notes I leave for myself, I am reminded of the list my mom kept at home. I used to scribble on it mindlessly while studying. I never got why she got so mad if I displaced it. I now know.

**Your days change.**  
Your Friday becomes your Saturday. Your Saturday your Sunday. And your Sunday becomes the day you detox, go to the gym, make sure you have clothes in your wardrobe, toothpaste in your fridge and eggs in your fridge.

I might (or might not) have exaggerated some of these.
