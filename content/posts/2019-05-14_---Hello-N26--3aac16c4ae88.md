As part of my process, I like to explore the product and team I am hoping to work with. Here are my quick thoughts on the product, and areas I see myself being helpful with.

🚸**Before downloading the application**  
The Google play store describes N26 as “The Mobile Bank, Europe’s first completely mobile bank, trusted by more than 2,500,000 customers.”

While any kind of first application is a bit daunting, I found the number of people using it as a motivator to go ahead and download it.

🚀**Onboarding**  
The striking similarity between the onboarding of Monzo and N26 was hard to miss. While the first few screens do a good job of summing up all that you could do with the app, I found the images a bit pixelated and felt a better job can be done at ensuring they all belong to the same visual family.

⚠️**Wait, no double verification?**  
Since N26 is not available in India, I asked a friend in UK to make an account and share the credentials. I was doubtful it will work, but it worked without asking me to verify any further details.

I would have felt a little more secure if a one-time password(OTP) send on my email/mobile was used to verify. Some applications go a step further in automatically detecting the OTP sent on the registered mobile number.

👀**First impressions!**  
It felt simple, modern, and enjoyable — like it claimed to be. The primary navigation comprising of spaces, account and upgrade gives it a very low learning curve. Well defined call-to-actions like “Add money”, and “Pair your device” in the cards gives me something to do as soon as I get in.

The discreet mode is a very unique and well-thought-out feature.

📈**I am missing a summary.**  
I looked online and while I enjoyed a clean interface with my current balance and transaction history, I would have enjoyed having a summary.

Some of the metrics I feel it could have  
• Upcoming committed transactions of the month (rent, wifi, etc)  
• Alerts and my spending pace with respect to my pre-set monthly budget

🌟 **I like my space.**  
Spaces were my absolute favorite. Such aesthetic custom images, coupled with delightful interaction of drag and drop was a joy to use.

Some of the additional features I could have used   
• Adding people to my space, say a shared space of world trip with my partner  
• After a transaction, an option to add it to a shared space  
• Scheduled auto-payments to my different spaces.

#### **Some other things that I would love to work on as part of the team**

✏️ **UX writing guidelines**  
Money matters. A bank people love, is a bank who talks to them in in their language, like a human.

> **Do all our error messages sound like a human, or we using some technical jargon? Are we consistent? Do we reflect our voice and tone as a product?**

These are some questions I would like to work on. I am not sure if the team uses one internally. If they do, I would love to contribute to it. If not, I would love to start building it. Here is a [case study](https://chhavishrivastava.com/guideline.html) on how I build at my present company.

🌐**Social media presence of design team**  
While researching N26, I would have really like to read more about the design team and the culture first-hand from the designers.

As a [regular blogger](https://medium.com/@chhavi.justme), this is something I see myself contributing to. At my present company also, I help out with creating content for social media channels.

Thank you for reading this. I look forward to hearing from you. Chhavi
