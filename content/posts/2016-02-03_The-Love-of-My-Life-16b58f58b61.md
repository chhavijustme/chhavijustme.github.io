My dearest mom and dad,

I write this as words and hugs are the only currency we trade in our family. I write this as there are tons of things I never stop and thank you for. Small tiny weeny things that have made me, _me_. I would just like to pen down a few, bear with me.

> My name. Chhavi. I love it. I hope I can always stay true to it’s connotation, _your reflection_.

Tanvi. My sister. My crazy half. _She completes me_. And she stays up late, so she is there to handle all my mid-night dramas and anxiety attacks when you guys are fast asleep. ( Tan, you should just accept that your name was kept just to rhyme with mine :p )   
   
You have kept our relation simple. And _honest_. I know everything about you. You know everything about me. From the people I am texting at 2am to what I had in dinner. I still can claim to people on campus, if you cannot find me, call my parents. They will know where I am. This is because either you are too cool or I am too nice.  
   
You have let me nurture my love for dressing up in the finest. You have heard my confessions of being deeply in love with clothes and earrings and shoes and have understood it. You have taken me on shopping sprees when I screwed up my test and sent clothes when I was away from home and feeling low.  
   
You have made me _wanderlusty_. I have memories of sun, sand and beer in Goa. Of tea gardens and houseboats in Kerala. Of snow and apple fields in Manali. Of sea diving for corals and shopping for pearls and good fish in the Andamans. Of the walks on the Mall road and churches in Shimla. Of temples and collecting sea shells in Puri.

> These memories are like the glowing fireflies inside me, the ones that keeps me sane when the world around me gets insane.

You have taught me to _read and write_. Read, read and read like your life depends on it and write, write and write like every word you write matters. Not to mention, you gifted me the genes for it and a whole lot of books and night lamps too.

> You have told me to be the propeller in this bell jar of hypocrisy and mediocrity. You have told me to make sure I break that bell jar because bell jars are made to hold vacuum and Victorian watches and not girls like me.

You have pushed me from my comfort zone and forced me to gather my nerves and get out there to fulfill what is not merely a word, _dreams_. You have assured me that the worst that could happen was maybe enough to stir me, but not shake me.

You have loved me like I was and had always been the answer and the question and what world thinks never mattered. You have loved me enough to let me love and care for people without trying to search for the very question that matters.

> You have made me strong, you have kept me going.

As I sit wearing this over sized sweater of yours dad and the earrings you got me mom, 1500km away from home, I want to tell you.

I love you. With all my heart and soul.

_Happy 25th Marriage Anniversary._

Just yours,  
Chhavi :)
