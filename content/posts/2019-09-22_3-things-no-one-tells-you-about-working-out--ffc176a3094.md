..which are good to know, even if you don’t work out.

I am a part of a group fitness scene, aka the alternate to the weekend-pubbing scene here in Bangalore. When I started out, I did not know what glutes or hamstrings are. Well, now I know exactly where they begin and exactly where they end. All thanks to…

Some other things that I did not know..

#### 1\. Weights do not have a fixed weight.

Don’t believe me, try it out yourself.

Reluctant, or bored or show up after long, weights are so heavy. Did not fit into your old jeans last week? Or there is a 50 something-year-old person lifting a 40- something-kg barbell in front of you? Your barbell feels like the good 10 kgs, almost as light as it looks.

#### 2\. You get to know people.

You know how they say, you should learn to dance with a person to really know a person. Well, just add working out with them to the list. The grunts and the faces, the stamina and the need for space post-workout. You will get to know all of it at one go. (If you get it, you get it. 😉)

**3\. Motivation is inversely proportional to the distance between you and the gym.  
**You leave your office, you don’t really wanna do it. You get a bit closer, you start spotting familiar elements — gym bags, gym clothes, people carrying the same reluctant aura.

You get in, and there you are. Everyone is burning those calories, the same way. You wear your shoes and well, you just do it.

I was always the “Oh I walk around in shopping malls” kind of person. But working out has been a life-changer. It has become my place to clear my head and think things through.

It’s the place I ask for things I want, with every rep. Almost like my own sacred chanting. Well and, I have to be desperate. Can’t keep holding that heavy barbell over my head for long you know!

Until the next rep,  
Chhavi
