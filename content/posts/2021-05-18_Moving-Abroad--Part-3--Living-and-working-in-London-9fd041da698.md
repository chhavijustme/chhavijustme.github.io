### 🤔 Why London

I was living and working in Barcelona when the pandemic hit. We started working from home in early March, and as we all know, everything that unfolded next did not come with a manual.

After August, I could figure this will go on longer. How much longer? I still don’t know.

I was super anxious —thinking if I get sick, how will I manage without speaking fluent Spanish. There were no direct flights back home, and no close family in the city. I did have a solid support system in my friends and colleagues (so grateful for that!💛), but I found London friendlier. I spoke the language, and I had close family members.

#### When you think about job hunting in the middle of a pandemic, while you are on a visa in another country where you don’t speak the language, and you haven’t met family for so long — leaving your comfort zone and gathering mental energy to do so wasn’t exactly appealing.

However, I did want to be proactive about how I handle this situation, and so I started applying to a few places.

My mindset was very different than when I was looking for jobs abroad previously. I was having fun at N26, and I was in no hurry to leave Barcelona. I knew I wanted to move to London, and I knew exactly what I was looking for in my next gig!

### 🔎 Finding jobs

I started applying through portals to test waters. I didn’t wanna reach out to my network for referrals yet as my portfolio was a work in progress, and I wanted to get a few practice rounds in.

Surprisingly, I did hear back from a lot of companies. Completely different experience than when I was applying the first time around.

My theory for this is — N26 was a strong brand in the European/UK startup ecosystem, I was applying right when most companies were coming out of hiring freeze, my recent projects and experience were relevant to jobs I was applying to, and like always I was doing my due diligence while applying.

More on this part here in Part 1.

_Paying it forward, and writing down everything that I learned._chhavii.medium.com](https://chhavii.medium.com/moving-abroad-part-1-tips-for-job-hunting-2b6b862c1ed7 "https://chhavii.medium.com/moving-abroad-part-1-tips-for-job-hunting-2b6b862c1ed7")[](https://chhavii.medium.com/moving-abroad-part-1-tips-for-job-hunting-2b6b862c1ed7)

I chanced upon Bumble’s opening on Twitter and applied on their portal. I also messaged the hiring manager on Twitter just to make sure I had a fair shot at it.

### 💬 Interview process

One word, painless. That’s how I remember it because it was so quick and was very focused on capturing the right signals.

#### Interviews

1\. **Phone call with a Recruiter** to discuss my background, and expectations.  
2\. **Video call with Head of Design and Head of Product Design.**   
I was expecting this one to be one of the last rounds, but it was the first and I was very nervous. It turned out to be a super warm chat where we took turns to ask questions. I could ask my questions — I had tons because of my requirement list, and they asked me some good ones too.  
3\. **Design Portfolio.** I was asked to pick 2–3 recent projects and talk about them. I picked my most recent one and we talked in-depth about the process, flows, trade-offs, and visual design.   
4\. **Chat with a User Researcher and a Product Designer** — By this interview, I remember being very calm and relaxed. It was a very casual talk where we chatted about collaboration, past projects, processes, and team culture.

#### 🤔 Things that I think worked for me

Personally, I was more familiar and prepared with how things work at a fast-moving, consumer-facing product startup. My answers and work showed that maturity as compared to last time. I was also very honest with things I needed to work on.

The hiring manager was looking to build a truly diverse team, with folks from different backgrounds and stories.

As always, I cannot deny the huge role timing plays. I saw that tweet at the right time, and the team had a role for my experience level.

### 📑 UK Visa

I was scarred by my Spain visa process, so I was prepared for this move to take months, especially in the middle of a pandemic. UK visa process surprised me and it surprised me so well. The entire process took around 2–3 weeks, and it wasn’t heavy on paperwork. Mainly it was a sponsorship letter from the employer, proof of my degree and that it was taught in English.

I moved very much in the middle of a strict lockdown, both in Spain and in UK. Apart from everything that you have to arrange for a move (flights, sending your stuff, banks, new apartments, residency cards, etc), I also had to coordinate lockdown situations! That was fun. 🙃

#### I was (am) very aware that this was such a big privilege — switching countries and jobs by my choice during a pandemic and so I took everything in my stride.

I had to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days when I landed in London, and after that, I could collect my residency card, and start working!

### 🐝 Working at Bumble

I am a big fan of working at Bumble — not just because of the amazing product, but because of people and its culture.

I will write more about this in my coming blogs — but very briefly, so far, really good. We are a surprisingly small team of designers (product and content designers) dedicated full-time on Bumble, around 12 of us last I counted. We all joined during the pandemic and at the time of writing, I have not met my colleagues in person. It’s been all through a screen — so yes I don’t know who is the tallest of us.

I was also lucky to be around for a big milestone — IPO. Frankly, things did not change at all pre and post IPO. We are the same set of folks, working on the same set of challenges with the same energy and passion.

Also, I promise, I will write a thorough blog about working at Bumble in a few weeks.

### 🏠 Flat-scene

Make peace with the fact that London is expensive, and renting is super expensive. You know how they say London is expensive, it is. Very.

I am told there are multiple small villages within the London city. Every “village” has its own personality and there is something for everyone. Any kind of house and any kind of vibe is on the market — for a price of course!

Since I moved during a lockdown I did not have much time to walk around and compare these villages. So I picked something I was familiar with, and knew was safe.

There are both apps and Facebook groups to find what you are looking for. For a price, of course. Like I said.

### 🥔 Food

You will have absolutely no problem when it comes to food in London. It is a heaven for all foodies — even if you are vegetarian, or a vegan. Not just the restaurants, even the supermarkets are so friendly for Indian food shopping.

I was pleasantly surprised to find Maggi, and Ghee in Tesco, a common supermarket chain here.

So yes one doesn’t need to worry about food when one moves to London.

### 💸 Budget

Okay so when I moved to Barcelona, I used to freak out thinking in rupees. When I move to London, I just convert to euros and roll my eyes. A lot of things like monthly groceries and transport were so much cheaper in Barcelona.

I have only lived here during lockdown months, so I can very much assure you this budget will have to expand as things open up.

> _A rough breakdown of my monthly budget in GBP.  
> Rent — 1200 Pounds for a shared apartment (Yes I freak out too seeing this number)  
> Utility Bills — 400 Pounds (Watch out for the council tax when you pick a home)  
> Groceries — 150ish  
> Transport — Not sure yet, will update post lockdown  
> Travel — Not sure yet, will update post lockdown_

### 🌦 Day-to-day Life in London

First and foremost, make peace with the fact that you will have to talk about the weather a lot, and basically plan your entire life around it.

When I moved in November, it turned dark around 3 PM. With the freezing temperatures and lockdown, I seriously thought moving from Barcelona was stupid.

This is so new to me. You can basically never leave without a coat and a cap and gloves, or you will freeze. No matter what your weather app says.

Once you settle score with weather (not sure you ever do), you can start looking at the brighter side. Wait no sun for that, lol.

No, but definitely London is more friendly in terms of moving abroad — less paperwork, no language barrier, everything is super organized. I find it very similar to Bangalore (yes, sometimes even with the traffic)

It is a melting pot of cultures, the crowd is diverse and inclusive. It is really easy to blend in, and make London your home. A few days back, I walked across London, around 14 kms, and I had a chance to see it more closely. I am slowly, and steadily starting to love my life here. I will keep you updated here, or on Instagram!

Thank you for the patience with this part. With everything going on India, I found a lot of things highly irrelevant. I hope wherever you are, you are holding up fine, and keeping safe :)

Part 4 Next Tuesday. This is more for me, than for you!
