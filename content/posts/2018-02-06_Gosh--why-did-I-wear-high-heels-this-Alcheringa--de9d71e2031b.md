All things become of high importance with huge emotional components as soon as you add the adjective **last** to it. Last semester, last birthdays on campus, last wintery-foggy mornings on campus, etc etc. Hence, you can understand when I start talking about the last Alcheringa. The very fact that it has _las_t attached to it, justifies buying the expensive ordinary chicken tandoori, crowded dance arenas, forced enthusiasm, countless poses for #Alcher\_wali\_dp and wait for it, high heels in cold weather.

Let me tell you why that deserves to be justified. On a campus where you find more testosterone than most of the other educational institutes, dressing up for the fairer sex is almost unnecessary. Whatever minimum fashion sense JEE preparation leaves us with, we tend to give up in the perpetual state of being here,_“Sab chill hai”_. Add to that the fact that bicycle is our staple ride on campus, and hopping off buses and ferries on a city trip, we almost never end up wearing anything that makes us look taller than an inch.

But then comes Alcheringa. The inertia of the everlasting chill is broken by the colourful or makeup-ed participants from other universities staying in our common rooms. Here you wake up with tangled hair with toothbrush creating vigorous foams in your mouth. There, the girls seem to be walking right outside a vogue magazine with high heels.

And it strikes you. You have a pair in the lowest rack, towards the back. The one you bought on a whim, just because it was on a sale. This pair of heels deserve an outing. There you go. It is only when your hearts are full of memories, and you have gorged on overpriced chicken and have sore feet + bad throat from all those concerts, you realize. You realize what evil creatures these high heels are.

Tending my sore feet,
