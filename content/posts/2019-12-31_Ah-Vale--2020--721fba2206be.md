To enjoying what has already begun.

_“Ah baalle, baallee”_, the cab driver said confidently while lugging my 25kg suitcase at the back of his car.

It was 6 AM in Barcelona, and I had landed a while back. A couple of unexpected things had already happened. One, it was drizzling. No, it was pouring. When you think Barcelona, you think ☀️

All I was seeing and feeling was, ☁️☔️

Two, while I had carried my entire existence in documents for the immigration officer, he had simply looked at my passport, and said.

_“Ah baalle, baalle”._

Why does everyone keep doing baalle baalle here. What relation could possibly be between Punjabi and Spanish? Also, if he runs away with my suitcases, do I have everything to survive the next few days?

Well, leap of faith. Like everything has been for last couple of weeks. With the same anxiety I had while getting on that one-way flight, I got on to the cab.

The city was still sleeping, and the rain had stopped. The autumn trees didn’t seem to mind it, nor did the stone buildings. I could hear the waves crashing by the shore at a distance, and a few early runners feeling right at home.

The city looked like it was ready to begin again. I think I was too.

Moving to a new country, where I don’t speak the language, to work in a completely new domain? I always thought I would do it. You know, in a soul-searching life-changing sometime-in-future kind of way. But never really thought I would actually do it NOW.

To make use of my one-day international pack, I googled “ah balle spanish”. Ah vale, the v pronounced as b, means okay. Two vale is used as a terms of endearment, and means it will be more than okay.

Ah vale. I thought it will be okay. Maybe even more than okay!

Here’s to the next ah vale, vale year.
