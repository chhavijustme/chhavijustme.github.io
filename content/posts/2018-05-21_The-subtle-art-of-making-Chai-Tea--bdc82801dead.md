It’s as subtle (and complex) and understated as the art of making Maggi.

Due to some unforeseen conditions at home, I am responsible for the single most activity performed with religious fervor in our home. Making tea, morning and evening (and sometimes night). If our house was a tech startup, every sprint would start with “Make tea, drink tea” and every bonus will include “Extra tea”. Such is the love for chai in any Indian household.

Now, as a kid. I was once “allowed” to make tea for my family. While I thought I did quite a job at it, my family members thought I did not take my duties seriously. I did the unholy act of pouring milk before the tea leaves had completely soaked in the hot boiling ginger water. I should have known.

#### “Tea making is an art. It reflects your patience and state of mind,” Declared my dad.

From then on, I resorted to just being a devoted tea drinker. That itself is quite a ritual. You sip. You get a glucose biscuit, Parle-G. Dip it in and take it out in just the right amount of time, so that it does not soak and sink to the bottom.

If it does, your life and tea cup is screwed. In olden days, quite literally too. Prospective brides were asked to prepare tea for her potential in-laws. I can totally understand, I am going to put my guy through the same rigorous tests. Or have a house with chai shop at the end of the block.

Fast forward to today, where I am the tea maker. I carefully follow the audio instructions from my mom in the other room, “1 cup of water, 1 spoon of sugar, 1/2 spoon of tea”.

**_What about milk Maa? “Look at the colour of the tea and pour, and you will know.”_**

What? I will know? Isn’t this how it all went wrong in the first place?

Brewing my tea with hopes,
