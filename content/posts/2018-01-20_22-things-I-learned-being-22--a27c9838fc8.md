The 22nd element in the periodic table is Titanium. Lustrously silver and can withstand high strength, no wonder that’s how being 22 feels.

At least, that’s how it did to me. I made damn sure of one thing. That I can sing along Taylor Swift, **“I feel like 22”** even when I am 80. Just putting some pointers for me here after I complete singing that song.

1.  Nothing that a hot shower can’t fix. Remind yourself this during every rough day you are having. Mint tea is overrated.
2.  Nice smelling stuff on you, you like. Make sure your Amazon wish-list is full of them. Always keep up the hope that Amazon might just gift them to you.
3.  Sangria is your drink. Whenever you are confused looking at those hilarious, blush-worthy cocktail names about sunsets and you know what, order this. It takes the edge off , but also leaves you fully capable of telling the Uber guy your way to home.

4\. You were okay traveling solo. You were more than okay. You liked walking around alone, taking pictures and mental notes to hold as memories. You might want to do it again.

5\. It was also okay to spend the very last of you summer stipend on traveling. Even though the end-of-season sales hurt as of now, do it all over again. It changed you in a way, you could not have guessed.

6\. Leaving your to-do list aside, binge-watching is a necessity every once in a while. It’s okay bingeing, not okay feeling betrayed seeing Meghan Markle running off to marry a royal.

7\. You read a lot. But you also read pretty mainstream-ish stuff. If you read what everyone is reading, you also think what everyone is thinking. Read to lead, dear.

8\. You don’t need to know the people longest to be friends. Sometimes you make the best of friends in the shortest of durations.

9\. Have the hard conversations when they are needed. Sometimes, they are only hard in your head.

10\. People don’t care about your blogs as much you think they do. They take usually 2 minutes of their 10080 minutes in a week. So, better hit Publish anyways.

**11\. In life, you get what you have the courage to ask for.**

12\. Rescue a dog. Adopt it.

13\. Wear the most cushiony-comfortable-est shoes you can while you travel. Do not learn this the hard way, which you already have.

14\. Having a priority list makes a lot of hard decisions, easy. You know what I am saying here.

15\. People make all kinds of intelligent stuff you didn’t know you were living without. Use them.

16\. Do not compare anyone’s life through the Instagram-y filters. Appreciate, that perfect moment they framed for you to stumble upon while scrolling your feed. In short, like the pictures you like.

17\. B\*itch. Sl\*t. It’s not okay to let anyone label women like that. Speak up, right there, right then.

18\. Never go too long without a haircut that makes Coco Chanel proud. She is the one said, _“A woman who cuts her hair, is about to change her life”._

19\. Everything is difficult until you do it for the first time. Bake that cake.

20\. Be choosy about the souvenirs you get back.

21\. Life’s best advice can be found in comic strips.

22\. Choose your people. Stick by them, through thicks and thins. They are your best shot at having a personal-cheerleading-squad and life-emergency-response-team rolled into one. Be the same for them.
