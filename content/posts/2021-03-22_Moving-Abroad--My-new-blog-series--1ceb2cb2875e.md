I have always had a love-hate relationship with writing. I like writing about my lifeâ€Šâ€”â€Šcapturing those tiny specks of humor others might have missed. I am also very critical about itâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI donâ€™t publish something which I would personally not read. It has to be crisp, honest, and read like I talk. This means very little of what I write make it out.

> So I came up with a hackâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhat if I write something not for myself, but for the Chhavi I was 3 years ago? I would have truly appreciated any help I could get to get closer to my dream of living inÂ Europe.

My mom planted this seed when I was a teenager. She wanted her daughters to experience the best the world has to offer. And so twice a week, for four years, she drove me on her two-wheeler, come sun, wind, or rainâ€Šâ€”â€Što French classes. We lived in a tier 2 city in India, and she had never been to France or Europe or outside India.

#### **And that was it. She planted the seed, and it grew up as me being super ambitious and determined to live in Paris in a studio apartment, and have a perfect French wardrobe capsule (she also got me monthly issues ofÂ Vogue).**

So even though I did not land up in Parisâ€” I landed in Barcelona and now in London. I realize a few others on the internet (at least in my Twitter DMs) are on a similar journey.

So I took a weekend, to write about my journey and things I learned so far. Mostly for myself to be honest, so that I can pick up the next big thing I wanna do. Heads up, itâ€™s probably gonna be crochet because my mom is really into it these days.

#### I donâ€™t like it when YouTubers babble for a long while before telling me how to just open this wine bottle without a cork screw. Please just get to the point. So this was that long introduction.

I divided it into four parts, and hoping to cover as many aspects as possible.

I am sorry, I wish I was like Netflix. Be able to hit publish on all four together. It would give me too much anxiety though.

Part one is out! ðŸŒŸ
