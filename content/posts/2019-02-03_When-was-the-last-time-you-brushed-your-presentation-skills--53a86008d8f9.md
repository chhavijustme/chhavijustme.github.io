The basics of presentation skills never change, it’s just how good you get at them. Jumping right into them.

**Treat presentations as a design problem.**  
Start with creating personas of your audience and cater every slide with a goal. Modifying the pitch to meet the motivations of your audience is the true art of presenting.

**Know the flow of thoughts of your audience.**  
Frame your pitch/slides to answer the So-So What-Now What. So you have this idea. So what you have this idea, why is it good. Now that I am sold on this idea, what next?

**Guide the audience to the milestones through words.**   
Declare the milestones at the beginning. All through the presentation, keep mapping the slides/ keep creating the visual map verbally to indicate how far have we reached. _“As we talked in the beginning, this is what we need to solve this why.”_

**Start right.**  
No “My name is and I am here to”.   
No “Hmmm.. Aaahh”.   
No “Let me share an experience”.  
Start with the story. Start with an astounding fact.

**Show and tell.**  
Cut down the words on your slides and replace them with what you have in your head. If you put words, they are going to read it and not listen to you. Do you want that?

**Read your audience.**  
Know when to stop selling your idea and switch to what you want from them to execute the idea.

**Leave an impression.**  
Keep a slide in your presentation to be put up when the feedback and critique session is on. I usually had a thank you slide, and it didn’t serve any good. I feel one with the Why, the How and the What should have been better.
