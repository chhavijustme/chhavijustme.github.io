the 25th element in periodic table is manganese

the 25th element in periodic table is manganese — it’s a transition metal which is rarely found alone, and used for most alloys. basically, it’s very good for mixing into other elements to make them stronger. i hope the year 25 does the same for me. it makes my other years stronger.

being 25, i learned.

#### 👩‍💻 On career

• it’s a privilege to be able to choose where you work/who you work with.  
• make good friends in your colleagues, you look forward to Mondays.  
• you don’t have to be 100% all the time  
• make peace with having a MVP of your portfolio rather than nothing  
• everybody is just mostly building it up as they go. even your thought leader on the bird app.

#### ⏰ On time

• manage your energy, not your time.  
• do not compare your timeline to anybody else — we all had very different starting points, and we all have very different goals.  
• it’s alright to wake up at 8 AM, it’s alright to wake up at 5AM — as long as you slept well.  
• things work out in their own time. they usually, always, almost, have a way of working out in the end.

#### 🖥 On zoom calls

• nobody minds a smile, even if it’s across screens.  
• everybody is simply looking at themselves.  
• wear pants, it helps.

#### 🦋 On life lessons

• how to use a dishwasher, an oven, wine opener, and a can opener  
• my breath is my anchor, my anchor is my breath  
• your body is growing every moment, water it.  
• personal victory always precedes public victory

#### 🍕On cooking

• soul food is a thing. mine is shakshuka on a rainy afternoon, daal chawal on a Sunday afternoon, Maggi after midnight, and sushi when I am happy.  
• food has power to connect people, to heal relationships.

#### **👁 On social media**

• keep your real life better than your life on the gram.   
• zero notification, zero news on your phone.   
• be kind. be f\*cking kind.

#### 👯‍♀️ On friends

• diversify your friend circle like you would diversify your investment portfolio.  
• it’s alright to outgrow some friendships. be okay with that.

#### ❤️ On love

• you can only love others, if you love yourself first  
• love with all your heart, and soul. it gives you courage.
