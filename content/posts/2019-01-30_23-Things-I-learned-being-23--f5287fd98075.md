The 23rd element in the periodic table is Vanadium, a malleable transition metal. Was this a transitional year for me? Yep.

Last year I wrote [22 things I learned being 22](https://psiloveyou.xyz/22-things-i-learned-being-22-a27c9838fc8). I have to write this list one more year to make it an annual thing. Partly for you, wholly for me. Partly summing up my year, wholly leaving reminders for myself.

1.  Try all kinds of eggs and learn how you like them. I like them sunny side up!
2.  I graduated from the c[ollege of my dreams](https://medium.com/@chhavi.justme/100-reasons-we-will-always-miss-iit-guwahati-829af3d9082f), I lived through that dream fully. But do realize, sometimes we need to step out of the dream once it’s done and start working towards the next. Do not let that one dream define you.
3.  Moved to a new city and earned my first paycheck. Learned the ridiculous amounts of taxes we have to pay!
4.  Learned to live alone — Trust me, it’s all about knowing when it’s time to take long baths to unwind. And when it’s time to get up and do the laundry.

#### 5\. Allowed myself the freedom to quit things I wasn’t enjoying — projects, parties, and even people. It’s okay, it’s our choice.

6\. Started acknowledging the blaring _“this person is sh\*t”_ alert that we hear between all the noise in our heads. It goes off when you meet people that are trying to drag us down. I strictly follow point 5 for further steps.

7\. Got me a Medium membership. I had told myself I will once I start earning. Invest in yourself, it pays off.

8\. This might be the first year ever that I finished a journal within a year, till the very last page. Writing helps, period.

9\. Remember to check in early on your flights to get a window/aisle seat. Your rare talent of sleeping on flights is useless without it.

10\. A walk to clear your head works magic. A walk through the cobbled streets of European cities cleanses your soul.

11\. Learned you have to be stronger than your excuses to have an active gym membership. You get stronger with every session.

12\. Lived in a foreign city for a week, and experienced the joy of telling tourists which bus to get on like a local.

#### 13\. Stopped cribbing I am one year closer to 30. [It’s a luxury denied to many](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fatima-ali-cancer).

14\. Make peace with the fact that everyone’s life is very different, and learn to be genuinely happy for other people’s achievement.

15\. Do not panic if you get on the wrong bus/train in a city you know nothing about. Whenever you realize it’s the wrong bus, get off and start again. (Getting the metaphors, no?)

16\. It is a good thing to check for the driver ratings before getting into a cab alone at the middle of a night in an unknown city.

17\. Sangria is still my drink. Now I also know how I like my Sangria.

18\. Be grateful. Practice gratitude. It makes life lot better to live with.

#### 19\. Be patient with people you love. Also, reply to their texts.

20\. No one got lucky, they worked for it. Just like you did.

21\. Ideas are cheap currency. Execution is the real grit.

#### 22\. Just because you can, is never really the right reason to do it.

23\. Turn the page. Moving on from things that didn’t work out is a part of life.
