Hey there, hello!

I am Chhavi and this is my take on the design exercise. Thank you for taking the time to review it. 😊

#### Problem Statement

To create a mobile application which brings to readers, critically acclaimed books in an easy-to-digest, engaging format and helps them expand their perspectives.

Here is a [prototype of the final solution](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/6KS053CYHBG#/screens). Scroll below for my process! :)

[**A prototype of the final solution\`**  
Made using Invision](https://invis.io/6KS053CYHBG "https://invis.io/6KS053CYHBG")[](https://invis.io/6KS053CYHBG)

### Process: Part 1

> This section focuses on understanding the users and the various ways they will use the application.

**Understanding the users  
**For this application, I wanted to focus on millennials who read on the go. As an avid reader, I have tried several book reading apps. I was curious about what they read, when they read, and how they read.

I relied on existing literature on reading patterns of millennials for my study. I came across some interesting facts which helped me design the screens later.

From one of [my previous project](https://chhavishrivastava.com/pragati-vr.html), I am also familiar with effective ways of building habits for the usage of an app. Another area I deep-dived into was how to retain more from books you read.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*KZRfyuRmMSC4ZC6exmI5Tw.jpeg)

I also conducted a quick market analysis for the latest mobile apps on Product hunt, Reddit, etc and noted down their key features.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*zZUou6qIuy2qiFsKNQnFtQ.jpeg)

To put together my research and insights, I drew out a journey map. It also helped me identify the pain points and gaps. For the journey, I took a user story of Joy trying to read a new book on a mobile application.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*w82x3ZVKPiX7nvOUZGknXw.jpeg)

With this initial research, I had a good understanding of who the user is and what goals the app should accomplish. To keep my decisions in sync with all my research, I made use of a user persona I built based on my research and understanding.

With this, we are all set to jump into the second part of the process.

### Process: Part 2

> This section explains some of the assumptions, goals, and design decisions that were made.

**Assumptions**

1.  Users have already been onboarded, and have provided their reading preferences.
2.  The app can subscription-based model, which has not been detailed out in these workflows.
3.  It does not aim to disrupt the publishing market, or the ways books are written.

**Goals**

1.  Help users read more, and retain more from the books they read
2.  Provide a distraction-free reading session, and engage them to keep coming back.
3.  Easy-to-use, contextual interface that can be used for reading on-the-go.

**Ideation and sketching**

I always like to start with a pen and paper. I prefer not jumping into digital tools unless I have a fair amount of clarity on the framework.

**User flow  
**Once I have a fair level of clarity on what goes where, I like to bring it together to see the overall flow of tasks. I am very comfortable using Sketch and symbols to draw up wireframes like these.

I also took some crucial design decisions while wireframing.

#### Quick user testing

To satisfy the feedback-monger in me, I asked my flatmates to do a usability test. I asked them to perform three tasks:  
1\. Continue reading a book  
2\. Start a new book  
3\. Find notes of an old book

**Iteration based on feedback**

### Process: Part 3

> This section details out the visual design, prototype, and key takeaways.

With the “how it works” part of the application sorted, it was now time to jump into “how it looks”. I wanted to give the application a clean, minimal interface. Again, I used Sketch for creating the user interfaces.

Here is a link to the [prototype](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/6KS053CYHBG) I built using Invision. The detailed descriptions follow below.

### That’s all folks!

**What would I have done differently if I had more time**

1.  **Explore more options, and test it with more users:** While exploring navigation, layouts I would have liked more time to explore options. Also, I prefer to conduct well-planned tests with at least 5 people.
2.  **Some other ideas that I would have liked to explore:** I had ideated some interesting ideas like showing the general interest of users over chapters, speed reading, etc. I would also have liked to explore gestures for switching chapters/ night mode.

> I will look forward to your feedback and comments on this.

#### Oh, just one more thing…

In my spare time, I explored the N26 app and here are some of my thoughts on it. If you would like to take a look, they are present here.
